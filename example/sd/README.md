1. Use welford alg to quickly calculate standard deviation and mean.
2. The welford method integrated moving window feature, This allows us to ignore early data with excessive volatility.
3. Use the coefficient of variation(c.v) to reflect the confidence of the test result datasets.
4. When the c.v is less than 0.05, we terminate this test.
